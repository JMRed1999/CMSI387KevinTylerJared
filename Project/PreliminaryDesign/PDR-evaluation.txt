CMSI 387 Operating Systems
   Semester Project
===================================

Wow, this is a wonderful idea!  With the advent of newer computers
that don't have USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 ports, USB-C is becoming the
go-to port.  However, few mouse makers have yet to get on board so
that there are not many mice with USB-C wireless dongles yet.  Thus
bluetooth is becoming the way to go for such peripheral connectivity
and making it easier to manage will be VERY nice!

Very useful idea!!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
