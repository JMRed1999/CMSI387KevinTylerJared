Very nice work on this assignment!

Thanks for your feedback on your interests in the class...
I shall include more on security in the coming weeks!

Not *quite* on the output of "userInfo.c" ~ your program prints
the output all on one line and the intent was to print each item
on a separate line but using a single printf statement.

Close enough this time, though....  :)
