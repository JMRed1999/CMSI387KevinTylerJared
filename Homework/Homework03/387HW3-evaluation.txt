OUTSTANDING job on Q1.  Platform independence!!

Great job on Q2.  The global mutex will indeed solve the problem of a race
condition so that the philosopher who drops the two chopsticks cannot simply
pick them up again!

Q3, not quite what was being asked.  The idea was to use the execlp system
call to execute the "tr" command.  Also, the code was supposed to be in "C"
so why is there a "namespace" line in there?  It works, though; partial credit.

Great job!
