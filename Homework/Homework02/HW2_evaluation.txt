==================================

Question 1 mutex reversing:          5/ 5 points
   EXCELLENT analysis and example!

Question 2 auditing code change:     5/ 5 points

Question 3 test program:            18/20 points
   Unfortunately, because you used a vector package to which I have no
      access, I can't run your code for either this problem or number 4.
      I reviewed the code, and knowing your group's performance, I'm sure
      it works.  However, I have to take points off since I can't actually
      run it myself.

Question 4 notifyall() addition:     8/10 points
   See question 3

Question 5a 2-phase locking:         5/ 5 points

Question 5b short read locks:        4/ 5 points
   Actually, no, it's not possible.  With read committed isolation, the
      writes will have exlusive locks, so T1 will have exclusive write 
      access for the duration of the transaction.  Since write locks are
      exclusive, in this case it's the same outcome as with two-phase
      locking.

Question 5c snapshot isolation:      5/ 5 points

Question 6 virtual address xlate:    5/ 5 points

Question 7 calc. explanation:        5/ 5 points

Question 8 loop 4096 analysis:      20/20 points
   VERY well done on this one.  Good write up and nice work on the code.

Question 9 fork() tree:             15/15 points
   For this one, it would have been helpful to have the PID's for each of
      the forked processes.  The tree shape looks right, though....

Total 95 out of 100 = 95.00% which is an A
